# Sudoku Vocabulary App

# What it is?
The Sudoku Language Learning App project is an interactive app build on Android Studio that enables users to learn Chinese vocabulary while playing the game of sudoku.

# Motivation
We built this project to provide users with a convenient and cost-effective way of learning a new language. Additionally, we aimed to offer users more control over the pace of their learning.

# Problem it Solves
Our Sudoku Language Learning App solves the problem of language learning being a dull and uninteresting task. By integrating language learning with the game of sudoku, users can learn Chinese vocabulary in a fun and engaging way.

# Technologies Used
We developed this project using Java and the Model-View-Controller framework, along with JUnit for testing.

# Features
(Screenshots of the project in finalTDDExamples file)
Our project offers serveral features:
  - Normal mode: In normal mode, users can select the size of the board (4x4, 6x6, 9x9, 12x12), with four to twelve vocabulary words to practice from, based on the size of the board they choose. The game objective is to fill in empty cells with the correct translation of the given word, ensuring that each row, column, and grid does not repeat any vocabulary word.

  - Listening mode: In listening mode, users must click on the numbers in the cells to hear a text-to-speech audio of the corresponding vocabulary word, similar to how normal mode works.
